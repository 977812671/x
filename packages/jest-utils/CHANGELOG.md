# CHANGELOG

## 1.2.0

> Added `anyOf` to test fields validity with multiple types. Renamed `ExtendedExpect` and `ExtendedMatchers` to `EmpathyExtendedExpect`
> and `EmpathyExtendedMatchers` because they were colliding with the jest ones. 

## 1.1.0

> Added URL assertions to test for URL validity and search query parameters being included

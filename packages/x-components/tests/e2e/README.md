Currently, there are two spec sources:

- The old ones which use default Cypress syntax: `default/**/*.spec.ts`
- The new ones which use Cucumber feature syntax: `cucumber/**/*.{feature,features}`

This configuration is within [cypress.json](../../cypress.json) file.

The idea is rewrite the default ones with Cucumber syntax which is WIP. Please, remove this
 README.md and the default folder when this is already done.
